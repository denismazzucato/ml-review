# Testing Progress Report

We broadly distinguish between analyzers that apply verification after the model is developed *Model Deployed*, during the training phase *Model Training*, and during its preparation *Data Preparation*.

> References in the tables refer to the bibliography inside the review.

## Model Deployed

In addition, we further distinguish between *Complete* and *Incomplete methods*.

### Complete methods

#### SMT-based methods
