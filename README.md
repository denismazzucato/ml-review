# A Review of Formal Methods applied to Machine Learning

Our goal is to find a common benchmark able to effectively compare tools in the review

    Caterina Urban and Antoine Min√©, 2021, A Review of Formal Methods applied to Machine Learning, 2104.02466

This repo will ease users in the process of choosing the best fitting analyzer for your purposes, as well as giving an overview of the current state-of-the-art in verification of machine learning systems.

# Benchmark Overview

Here we show benchmarks used to test tools in the review. Obviously, a common single benchmark would be optimal in order to compare every analyzer, but this is inadmissible. Due to different input requirements, network compatibility, property tested, a single benchmark does not exist.
However, we identified a restricted number of general-purpose benchmarks in order to effectively compare tools among each other.

All the available benchmarks are summarized below:

|            Benchmark Id |              Property | Dataset |                                                               Supported Model |
| ----------------------: | --------------------: | ------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|      `local_robustness` |      Local Robustness |   MNIST | Neural Networks with fully-connected feed-forward layers and ReLU activations |
| `functional_properties` | Functional Properties | ACAS Xu |        Networks with fully-connected feed-forward layers and ReLU activations |

# Testing Progress Report

In this section, we report the tool testing status, for tools already tested we display which test has been used, cf. column **Benchmark**. We broadly distinguish between *Complete* and *Incomplete methods*.

<!-- We broadly distinguish between analyzers that apply verification after the model is developed *Model Deployed*, during the training phase *Model Training*, and during its preparation *Data Preparation*. -->

> References in the tables refer to the bibliography inside the review.

<!-- ## Model Deployed

In addition, we further distinguish between *Complete* and *Incomplete methods*. -->

# How to Repeat our Experiments

Our benchmarks can be run directly from this repo. For each tool we provide the container configuration file to easily run and repeat our benchmarks.

Thus, the only prerequisite in order to run our experiments is to install [singularity](https://sylabs.io/). Sometimes, we even provide the [docker](https://www.docker.com/) version.
